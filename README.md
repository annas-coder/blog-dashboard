# Blog Dashboard

A simple Blog Dashboard application built with React and Material UI. This app allows users to view, create, and view details of blogs. It utilizes virtual scrolling for efficient performance, a toaster notification for user interaction, and RTK Query for managing HTTP services.

## Features

- **Blog Listing**: A list of blogs displayed with virtual scrolling to reduce page load time.
- **Blog Detail Page**: A page that shows the details of a specific blog when clicked.
- **Create New Blog**: A button to create a new blog with fields for title, author, and body. After submission, the user is redirected back to the dashboard with a toaster notification.
- **Automatic Data Fetching**: The app automatically refetches data every 30 seconds to ensure up-to-date blog posts.
